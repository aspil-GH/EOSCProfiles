# Introduction	
EOSC Profiles are specifications that define common data models for EOSC entities (Providers, Resources, etc.) and related Code Lists, Taxonomies and Classifications. They contribute to the unified framework for describing and offering EOSC Resources to end-users in a harmonized way, guaranteeing the interoperability of resources metadata with open APIs. They allow automated exchange and management of the EOSC resource information and their accompanying data without human intervention (e.g., harvesting, etc).
